### **A minimalist Flutter framework for rapidly building custom designs.**

A framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying nested styles you have to fight to wrap.

:::tip

## **There is one Golden rule**

Use methods for (widgets & setting a value) and getters for (properties & getting a value)

:::

## Installation Guide

> Add the following dependency into your pubspec.yaml file

```javascript
dependencies:
    velocity_x: ^0.4.0
```

> You can install the above dependency by running the following code with pub:
> `flutter pub get`
>
> Now in your Dart code, you can import the components that are necessary for your application

```javascript
import "package:velocity_x/velocity_x.dart";
```

:::note
For better readability of the code use 'dart.lineLength': 200 in your fav IDE for dart formatting.
